**God save my troubled mind,**  
**Numbers are unrefined,**  
**Lost, I remain!**  
**Grant me the gift to see,**  
**Guesswork shall set me free,**  
**Words shall my answer be,**  
**Clear, yet arcane!**  

**Speak not what I have found,**  
**Let it not make a sound,**  
**Silent and true!**  
**Whisper it not aloud,**  
**Hide it beneath a shroud,**  
**Secretly spelled and proud,**  
**Known but to few!**
